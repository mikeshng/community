# Release Cadence

This document is to outline the Open Cluster Management (OCM) community release cadence.

The OCM release scheme uses the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/).

The OCM minor releases currently happen approximately four times per year.
The minor releases generally covers all the components of OCM to provide developers and users a consistent OCM experience.

The OCM patch release is expected to happen approximately a month after a minor release.
Not all components are expected to have a minor release.
Each component will perform a minor release based on the number of fixes needed from the community.

Additional patch release for components might happen prior to another minor release if there are critical security vunlerabiltiies fixes 
and/or demand from the community.
