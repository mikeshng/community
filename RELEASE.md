# Open Cluster Management (OCM) Releases

This document provides an overview of the release cadence, versioning strategy, and community involvement for the Open Cluster Management (OCM) project.

## Versioning

OCM follows the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/), which uses a version number format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. This approach ensures that version numbers convey meaning about the underlying changes.

## Release Cadence

### Major Releases

OCM major releases happen when the project has reached a maturity level where we are ready to move forward. These releases are less frequent and require thorough planning to ensure a smooth transition for users. Major releases are communicated well in advance to allow the community to prepare for any necessary adjustments.

**Milestone Achievement:** OCM v1.0.0 was released on June 20, 2025, marking a significant milestone in the project's journey. This production-ready release includes enhanced stability, new powerful features, and improved developer experience, making OCM ready for enterprise-scale deployments.

### Minor Releases

OCM minor releases currently happen approximately every three to four months. The minor releases generally cover all the components of OCM to provide developers and users a consistent OCM experience.

### Patch Releases

OCM patch releases are expected to happen approximately a month after a minor release. Not all components are expected to have a patch release. Each component will perform a patch release based on the number of fixes needed from the community.

Additional patch releases for components might happen prior to another minor release if there are critical security vulnerabilities fixes and/or demand from the community.

## Release Process

1. **Planning**: The release planning involves community discussions to identify the features and fixes to be included in the upcoming release. Community members are encouraged to participate in planning sessions, contribute code, and provide feedback on releases.
2. **Development**: Contributors work on the identified features and fixes, ensuring they adhere to the project's coding standards and guidelines.
3. **Release**: The release is tagged in the version control system, and release notes are published to inform the community about the changes.
